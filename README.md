#Title: Group Assignment App

###Type:
- Lab

###Time Required:
- 1 hour

###Prerequisites:
- Ruby
  - gets.chomp
  - Functions
  - Loops
  - Multi-file projects ('require')
  - File IO

###Objectives:
- Practice creating an interactive program
- Team building

###Activity:
- Students should work on this lab in groups.

###Explanation:
- Inform the students you'll be creating tools of the class. This lab serves as a literal team building exercise. 

- Folders:
  - **single-file** is the entire app in one single file
  - **multi-file** is the entire app broken into files, using `require_relative`

###Specification:
- Program should take a set of students and split them up into groups of a
  given size. eg if you have 9 students and you ask for groups of three, you
  will end up with  three groups of three of the students in each.
- You want to make sure that the same students aren't always grouped
  together with the same other people - so make sure that students are
  randomly assigned to their groups
- You want to make sure that there isn't just one student left over,
  working by themself. So make sure that the groups are as close to the same
  size as possible (eg if you split 17 people into 3 groups, they should be
  in groups of 5,6,6 not 5,5,7)

- #####Bonuses
  - Import the student information from a file
  - Save the groups to a file
  - Give each group a random name

###Post-mortem:
- What worked?
- Student misunderstandings?
